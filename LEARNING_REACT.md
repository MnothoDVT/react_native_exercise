##### LEARNING REACT NATIVE #####

### What is this readme for? ###
* For any DVT Software Developer keen on learning React Native (Getting Started)
* For DVT ReactJS or React Native employees looking at enhancing their React Native skills (Advance Concepts)

### What is React Native? ###

React Native is an open-source mobile application framework. It is used to develop applications for Android, iOS, Web, Windows and UWP(Universal Windows Platform). It enables developers to use React's framework along with native platform capabilities.

### Why React Native? ###

React Native is great for mobile apps. It provides a slick, smooth and responsive user interface, while significantly reducing load time. It is also much faster and cheaper to build apps in React Native as opposed to building native ones, without the need to compromise on quality and functionality.


### Pro's ###

* Reusable code;
You can use one codebase for both Android and iOS.
* Faster development;
Since only one codebase is required to handle iOS and Android, product development is much quicker.
* Reduced costs
All thanks to the ability to reuse code and faster development, which directly impacts the costs.
* Growing community;
React Native has a large and continuously growing developer's community.

### Con's ###

* Native code required;
Need for an expertise from a native developer for some platform-specific modules.
* Lacks Performance;
App Performance Lacks as Compared to a Pure Native App.
* Low Security;
Security is low because React Native is a JavaScript library and also an open source framework.

### Prerequisites ###

* Basic knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals.
* Familiarity with HTML and CSS.
* Familiarity with programming concepts like functions, objects, arrays, and classes.

### Getting Started == Fundamentals ###

* TypeScript; https://www.typescriptlang.org/
* JavaScript; https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript

### Beginner

* React Native; https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started
* React-Redux; https://www.udemy.com/course/react-native-the-practical-guide/

### Test your understanding

* Auto-Search App : Create a single screen app that has one text input that accepts a valid URL and then immediately loads the web-page in a webview/iframe component.


* Dog API & AsyncStorage App : Create an app that has 2 screens. On screen 1 (Home) it should display images of dogs, filtered by their breeds. A user should be able to mark a dog image as a favourite . Screen two should display all the users favourite dogs' pictures.
[You can get creative with this one] - Use redux and sagas for this one


### Advanced Concepts ###

* React + Hooks; https://www.udemy.com/share/101WbwCUAYclxbRng=/
* Component-Reusability; https://www.udemy.com/course/react-native-advanced/
* Unit Testing; https://www.udemy.com/course/react-testing-with-jest-and-enzyme/

### Test your understanding

*Wikipedia App: Create an app that accepts keywords/texts, performs a GET request on Wikipedia and displays the results in a list just below the text input. Afterwards, when a user clicks on row, he should be navigated to a detailed screen which has a navigation bar [ with its title being the Wikipedia page ] and a webview/iframe component to load that page. *Please use hooks and Context API in your solution.
